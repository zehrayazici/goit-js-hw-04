# goit-js-hw-04

This project was developed as part of the GoIT Fullstack Developer curriculum to advance practical JavaScript skills through the implementation of dynamic behaviors and interactive UI logic within a static HTML context.

In accordance with essential frontend development and JavaScript principles:

- JavaScript is extensively used to implement DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive logic based on user actions.
- Script files are organized within a dedicated `js/` directory to promote modularity and separation of concerns.
- Standard coding conventions are applied, including clear naming of functions and variables, and consistent formatting to improve readability and maintainability.
- The project focuses on vanilla JavaScript techniques without reliance on external libraries, facilitating deeper understanding of core language features.
- The HTML structure supports the dynamic behaviors implemented via JavaScript while maintaining semantic correctness.

This repository represents the fourth assignment in the GoIT JavaScript module and demonstrates practical application of scripting, DOM interaction, and event‑driven patterns in a client‑side environment.
